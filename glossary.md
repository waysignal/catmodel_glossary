##### Aggregate Exceedance Probability (AEP)
the probability that the associated loss level will be exceeded by the aggregated losses in any given year
e.g. there is a 10pc chance that the total losses for the year will be at least $1,234,000

##### Average annual loss (AAL)
the minimum annual charge (premium) over an infinite time period that would need to be collected to fund for the expected loss

##### Catalogue
a bundle of events possible to be simulated
can be sized at different times (10,000 or 50,000)
##### catastrophe 
an event that exceeds one or more of a number of metrics that define losses

##### Loss Exceedence Curve (or Exceedence probability curve), EP(x)
this is the output of a Loss Exceedence Chart. It plots on the y-axis the probability and on the x-axis, the loss exposure or a loss random variable . A point at ($100, 50%) means there is a 50pc chance that there will be a loss of $100 or greater.
+ up and to the right has the probability on the x axis and loss on y, invert the probability to get the return period
+ down and to the right has the probability on the y axis and loss on the x

##### Ensemble
the simulated collection of events created from a catalogue

##### Event loss table. 
event losses are then ordered in terms of magnitude from largest to smallest to generate the Loss Exceedence 

##### Exposure
Total amount of limits exposed to the event (Maximum loss)

##### Damage ratios 
the estimated repair cost as a fraction of the replacement cost of the building (i.e. insurance exposure or sum insured)
repair : replace
there is a range to this per location due to variability at the local scale

##### Hazard
the resulting danger from a peril

##### Occurrence Exceedance Probability (OEP) 
O(x) curve describes the distribution of the largest event in the year. x is the claim size
the probability that the associated loss level will be exceeded by any event in any given year
e.g. there is a 30pc chance that the largest event will cause $200,000 in damages this year

##### Peril
the actual potential cause of losses. the catastrophe, e.g. EQ

##### Probable Maximum Loss (PML)
the inverse of the OEP, defined in return period instead of probabilities. e.g. 1pc is 100yrs
can also be the inverse of the AEP

##### Vunerabilty function
mean damage ratio as a function of intensity 
the distribution of the damage ratio can also be shown on this chart

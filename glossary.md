##### Aggregate Exceedance Probability (AEP)
the probability that the associated loss level will be exceeded by the aggregated losses in any given year
e.g. there is a 10pc chance that the total losses for the year will be at least $1,234,000
##### Average annual loss (AAL)
the minimum annual charge (premium) over an infinite time period that would need to be collected to fund for the expected loss
##### Catalogue
a bundle of events possible to be simulated
can be sized at different times (10,000 or 50,000)
##### catastrophe 
an event that exceeds one or more of a number of metrics that define losses
##### Loss Exceedence Curve (or Exceedence probability curve), EP(x)
this is the output of a Loss Exceedence Chart. It plots on the y-axis the probability and on the x-axis, the loss exposure or a loss random variable . A point at ($100, 50%) means there is a 50pc chance that there will be a loss of $100 or greater.
+ up and to the right has the probability on the x axis and loss on y, invert the probability to get the return period
+ down and to the right has the probability on the y axis and loss on the x
##### Damage ratios 
the estimated repair cost as a fraction of the replacement cost of the building (i.e. insurance exposure or sum insured)
repair : replace
there is a range to this per location due to variability at the local scale
##### Ensemble
the simulated collection of events created from a catalogue
##### Event loss table. 
event losses are then ordered in terms of magnitude from largest to smallest to generate the Loss Exceedence 
##### Exposure
Total amount of limits exposed to the event (Maximum loss)
##### Exposure-based models
provide an estimate of risk wihtout using historical claims data from the specific location being modeled
##### Financial Structures
rebuilt cost = overspill(policyholder responsibility) + limit (insurer responsibility) + deductible(excess/retention) (policyholder responsibility)
sublimit = master limit that applies only to a subset of the exposures
Group Rollup > Portfolios > Policies > Locations
##### Hazard
the resulting danger from a peril
##### Gross loss
the loss to insurer after limits, deductibles and co-insurance are applied. before reinsurance
##### Ground up loss (GUL)
total loss before the application of any (re)insurance financial structures
used for model validation, and comparing to Gross loss to see the effect of modeled financial structures (limits, deductibles)
##### Net pre-cat
gross loss + facultative and per risk reinsurance applied; before catastrophe treaties
##### Occurrence Exceedance Probability (OEP) 
O(x) curve describes the distribution of the largest event in the year. x is the claim size
the probability that the associated loss level will be exceeded by any event in any given year
e.g. there is a 30pc chance that the largest event will cause $200,000 in damages this year
##### Peril
the actual potential cause of losses. the catastrophe, e.g. EQ
##### Probable Maximum Loss (PML)
the inverse of the OEP, defined in return period instead of probabilities. e.g. 1pc is 100yrs
can also be the inverse of the AEP
##### Vunerabilty function
mean damage ratio as a function of intensity 
the distribution of the damage ratio can also be shown on this chart

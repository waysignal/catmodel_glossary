##### Aggregate Exceedance Probability (AEP)
the probability that the associated loss level will be exceeded by the aggregated losses in any given year
e.g. there is a 10pc chance that the total losses for the year will be at least $1,234,000
##### Average annual loss (AAL)
the minimum annual charge (premium) over an infinite time period that would need to be collected to fund for the expected loss
##### Catalogue
a bundle of events possible to be simulated
can be sized at different times (10,000 or 50,000)
##### catastrophe 
an event that exceeds one or more of a number of metrics that define losses
##### Damage ratios 
the estimated repair cost as a fraction of the replacement cost of the building (i.e. insurance exposure or sum insured)
repair : replace
there is a range to this per location due to variability at the local scale
##### Ensemble
the simulated collection of events created from a catalogue
##### Event loss table. 
event losses are then ordered in terms of magnitude from largest to smallest to generate the Loss Exceedence 
##### Exposure
Total amount of limits exposed to the event (Maximum loss)
##### Exposure-based models
provide an estimate of risk wihtout using historical claims data from the specific location being modeled
##### Financial Structures
rebuilt cost = overspill(policyholder responsibility) + limit (insurer responsibility) + deductible(excess/retention) (policyholder responsibility)
sublimit = master limit that applies only to a subset of the exposures
Group Rollup > Portfolios > Policies > Locations
##### Hazard
the resulting danger from a peril (exposed wiring after an EQ)
##### Gross loss
the loss to insurer after limits, deductibles and co-insurance are applied. before reinsurance
##### Ground up loss (GUL)
total loss before the application of any (re)insurance financial structures
used for model validation, and comparing to Gross loss to see the effect of modeled financial structures (limits, deductibles)
##### Loss Exceedence Curve (or Exceedence probability curve), EP(x)
this is the output of a Loss Exceedence Chart. It plots on the y-axis the probability and on the x-axis, the loss exposure or a loss random variable . A point at ($100, 50%) means there is a 50pc chance that there will be a loss of $100 or greater.
+ up and to the right has the probability on the x axis and loss on y, invert the probability to get the return period
+ down and to the right has the probability on the y axis and loss on the x
##### Net pre-cat
gross loss + facultative and per risk reinsurance applied; before catastrophe treaties
##### Occurrence Exceedance Probability (OEP) 
O(x) curve describes the distribution of the largest event in the year. x is the claim size
the probability that the associated loss level will be exceeded by any event in any given year
e.g. there is a 30pc chance that the largest event will cause $200,000 in damages this year
##### Peril
the actual potential cause of losses. the catastrophe, e.g. EQ
##### Probable Maximum Loss (PML)
the inverse of the OEP, defined in return period instead of probabilities. e.g. 1pc is 100yrs
can also be the inverse of the AEP
##### Vunerabilty function
mean damage ratio as a function of intensity 
the distribution of the damage ratio can also be shown on this chart
##### Value at risk (VaR)
a single value from a loss distribution. can have an associated EP. the minimum aggregate loss in a given year for a given probability
##### Underwriting pools
sharing all risks among a group of insurance companies
##### Tail value at risk (TVaR)
represents the how much losses could be once a threshold has been met. threshold is a EP
##### Total insured value
maximum payout for a total loss
##### Sublimit
subset of the limit. earmarked for specified losses.
##### Step policies
cost of insurance increases incrementally (time or trigger events). used to make up for the gap between the incident date and claim file date. there is a mature year that represents something like the statute of limitations. (lawyer and practicing insurance)
##### Retrocedent
the ceding company between two insurers. the opposing party to the retrocessionaire
##### Resinsurance recoverables
insurance for insurers. includes the amount owed to the insurer by the reinsurer for claims. considered an asset on the insurers balance sheet
##### Risk excess of loss
type of reinsurance given to an insurer to protect against a single loss or risk incurred at a specific amount.
ceding insurer will only cover up to $5 but the loss is $1000000
##### Modifiers
characteristics used to seperate vunerability into categories. (e.g. building height, construction code, occupancy code)
##### Solvency
the ability to pay. Insurance companies keep solvency margins
##### Policy caps, exclusions
increases retention for the cedant
##### Subrogation
the transfer of loss recovery rights between cedant to insurer
##### Manuscript policy
customization of standard coverage
##### Loss-sensitive contracts
premiums depend on loss. the loss typically happens first before determining premium
##### Experience-rated policy
premiums depend on cedant's past loss history (moral hazard)
##### Paid loss retrospective policy (RRP)
the premium is adjusted based on the amount paid out (looks at cash flow to determine what needs to be paid), this is due when the insurer idemifies
##### Incurred loss retrospective policy (RRP)
the incremental premium is due in the year when the insurer has the best estimate of losses
##### Investment credit program (ICP)
cedant's funds are placed into a trust account that has a minimum balance required. builds with interest, non-taxable. has insurance tax-benefits. no collateral required.


+ Insured < Primary insurer < Reinsurance < Retrocession
+ Subject-matter < Direct Insurance < Reinsurer vs Subject-matter < Reinsurer  
+ insureres do not prefer high deductible policies
+ there are mechanisms to transform a full insurance contract to a partial insurance one

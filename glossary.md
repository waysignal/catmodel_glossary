##### Aggregate Exceedance Probability (AEP)
the probability that the associated loss level will be exceeded by the aggregated losses in any given year
e.g. there is a 10pc chance that the total losses for the year will be at least $1,234,000
##### Average annual loss (AAL)
the minimum annual charge (premium) over an infinite time period that would need to be collected to fund for the expected loss
##### Catalogue
a bundle of events possible to be simulated
can be sized at different times (10,000 or 50,000)
##### catastrophe 
an event that exceeds one or more of a number of metrics that define losses
##### Damage ratios 
the estimated repair cost as a fraction of the replacement cost of the building (i.e. insurance exposure or sum insured)
repair : replace
there is a range to this per location due to variability at the local scale
##### Ensemble
the simulated collection of events created from a catalogue
##### Event loss table. 
event losses are then ordered in terms of magnitude from largest to smallest to generate the Loss Exceedence 
##### Exposure
Total amount of limits exposed to the event (Maximum loss)
##### Exposure-based models
provide an estimate of risk wihtout using historical claims data from the specific location being modeled
##### Financial Structures
rebuilt cost = overspill(policyholder responsibility) + limit (insurer responsibility) + deductible(excess/retention) (policyholder responsibility)
sublimit = master limit that applies only to a subset of the exposures
Group Rollup > Portfolios > Policies > Locations
##### Hazard
the resulting danger from a peril (exposed wiring after an EQ)
##### Gross loss
the loss to insurer after limits, deductibles and co-insurance are applied. before reinsurance
##### Ground up loss (GUL)
total loss before the application of any (re)insurance financial structures
used for model validation, and comparing to Gross loss to see the effect of modeled financial structures (limits, deductibles)
##### Loss Exceedence Curve (or Exceedence probability curve), EP(x)
this is the output of a Loss Exceedence Chart. It plots on the y-axis the probability and on the x-axis, the loss exposure or a loss random variable . A point at ($100, 50%) means there is a 50pc chance that there will be a loss of $100 or greater.
+ up and to the right has the probability on the x axis and loss on y, invert the probability to get the return period
+ down and to the right has the probability on the y axis and loss on the x
##### Net pre-cat
gross loss + facultative and per risk reinsurance applied; before catastrophe treaties
##### Occurrence Exceedance Probability (OEP) 
O(x) curve describes the distribution of the largest event in the year. x is the claim size
the probability that the associated loss level will be exceeded by any event in any given year
e.g. there is a 30pc chance that the largest event will cause $200,000 in damages this year
##### Peril
the actual potential cause of losses. the catastrophe, e.g. EQ
##### Probable Maximum Loss (PML)
the inverse of the OEP, defined in return period instead of probabilities. e.g. 1pc is 100yrs
can also be the inverse of the AEP
##### Vunerabilty function
mean damage ratio as a function of intensity 
the distribution of the damage ratio can also be shown on this chart
##### Value at risk (VaR)
a single value from a loss distribution. can have an associated EP. the minimum aggregate loss in a given year for a given probability
##### Underwriting pools
sharing all risks among a group of insurance companies
##### Tail value at risk (TVaR)
represents the how much losses could be once a threshold has been met. threshold is a EP
##### Total insured value
maximum payout for a total loss
##### Sublimit
subset of the limit. earmarked for specified losses.
##### Step policies
cost of insurance increases incrementally (time or trigger events). used to make up for the gap between the incident date and claim file date. there is a mature year that represents something like the statute of limitations. (lawyer and practicing insurance)
##### Retrocedent
the ceding company between two insurers. the opposing party to the retrocessionaire
##### Resinsurance recoverables
insurance for insurers. includes the amount owed to the insurer by the reinsurer for claims. considered an asset on the insurers balance sheet
##### Risk excess of loss
type of reinsurance given to an insurer to protect against a single loss or risk incurred at a specific amount.
ceding insurer will only cover up to $5 but the loss is $1000000
##### Modifiers
characteristics used to seperate vunerability into categories. (e.g. building height, construction code, occupancy code)
##### Solvency
the ability to pay. Insurance companies keep solvency margins
##### Policy caps, exclusions
increases retention for the cedant
##### Subrogation
the transfer of loss recovery rights between cedant to insurer
##### Manuscript policy
customization of standard coverage
##### Loss-sensitive contracts
premiums depend on loss. the loss typically happens first before determining premium
##### Experience-rated policy
premiums depend on cedant's past loss history (moral hazard)
##### Paid loss retrospective policy (RRP)
the premium is adjusted based on the amount paid out (looks at cash flow to determine what needs to be paid), this is due when the insurer idemifies
##### Incurred loss retrospective policy (RRP)
the incremental premium is due in the year when the insurer has the best estimate of losses
##### Investment credit program (ICP)
cedant's funds are placed into a trust account that has a minimum balance required. builds with interest, non-taxable. has insurance tax-benefits. no collateral required. cedant gets interest income
##### Finite risk programs
for companies that are interested in a DIY approach. it's purpose is to ensure predictable cash flow. has to be considered a multi-year program. (debt capacity, lower cost of capital, may have tax benefits)
premiums deposits into an account like an ICP (is ICP a finite risk program?)
##### Loss portfolio transfer
unclaimed losses (they exist) are put into a portfolio. this is ceding the potential of claim settlements. the unpredictability of when the claims will be settled. shifting the timing risk. pays insurer the fee, premium, pv of net reserves for existing portfolio liabilities. handing it all over (cedant)
##### Adverse development cover
like the LPT in that it shifts the timing of losses(not the timing risk). additionally includes losses that have happened but not yet reported, unlike LPT which doesnt. there is no liability/claim reserves  transfer. therefore if losses exceed what the cedant has already reserved then a premium will be paid to the insurer for insurer to cover. more underwriting risk. only spot me if i do not want to cover (cedant)
##### Retrospective aggregate loss cover
in the middle between LPT and ADC, cedant pays for losses with a fixed payment equal to the value of the reserves and cedes liabilities to the insurer. insurer will cover up to a certain amount before cedant has to pay again. i will cover up to this much, more and youd have to pay (insurer)
##### Large line capacity
a policy is this if it has as a large loss exposure
##### Premium capacity
lots of policies on the same line of cover(? same thing that is covered, eg only car windows up to 300)
##### Facultative resinsurance
involves case by case review for any resinsurance transaction. the facultative contract agreement does not place either party under obligation, obligation will be handled under a different contract.
##### Treaty resinsurance
a contract where risks that fall under pre-agreed guidelines are automatically ceded and accepted
##### Proportional agreements
e.g. quota shares and surplus share arrangements
+ quota share is on fixed percentage of policy limit basis. the retrocedant reduces its unearned premium reserves and gains in surplus (from retrocessionaire) through a commission; is surplus bc reduction is larger than commission. insurer does not have to keep as much capital reserved.  ;; reinsurance pools are similiar but with the difference that if a member has a loss excess of a determined amount then the other pool members will share the balance
+ surplus share is on a variable percentage of policy limit basis, above the retrocedants rentention limit and up to a maximum. fractional sharing begins when the percentage is exceeded
##### XOL
catastrophe per occurence XOL(deductible, coinsurance), property per risk XOL(excess, retention), stop loss XOL(excess, ratio/dollar), aggregate XOL
##### Finite reinsurance
+ spread loss: cedant pays premiums into an experience account over a multiyear period. any losses will be paid out from this account. if there is a surplus at eoy then it is profit shared by cedant and reinsurer; excess returned to cedant. the reinsurer pays the losses discretely while the cedant pays continously. reinsurer pre-funds the losses
+ finite quota share: reinsurer pays for a fixed or variable proportion of the claims, LAEs as they occur (thus prospective cover), reinsurer will fund any shortfall and recoup over lifetime of agreement. ceding commission and reserve income typically cover the cedant's share of the losses
######  Expected value
sumproduct of x_i and p_i, if x_i represents losses then it is expected loss
##### Efficient frontier
boundary that provides the maximum possible return for a given risk
##### Basis risk
risk arising from the imperfections found in derviative market reference choice. a contract with this is cheaper because the hedger is covering extra risk without additional premium
##### Rate on the line
amount of coverage provided | premium paid ; premium can be determined by dividing rate on the line by the actuarial probability of loss(minus 1) == 0 is actuarially fair (pure premium).
##### Clash loss
when various insurance lines are impacted by claims simultaneously
##### Combined ratio
paid out / premiums
##### Credit risk
the risk of intermediaries in risk transfer, risk financing, or hedging solutions not fulfulling their obligations. ART products can reduce or eliminate credit risk

+ Insured < Primary insurer < Reinsurance < Retrocession
+ Subject-matter < Direct Insurance < Reinsurer vs Subject-matter < Reinsurer  
+ insureres do not prefer high deductible policies
+ there are mechanisms to transform a full insurance contract to a partial insurance one
+ insurance market harden = low exposure transfer products are competitively priced compared to full insurance
+ insurance attaches at price, can be layered
+ ceding commission in exchange for pass through of premium
+ reinsurance allows for a reduction in unearned premium reserves which increases the insurer's capital position
+ (facultative contract on proportional|excess basis)(probable maximum loss, maximum foreseeable loss)
+ 10m xol 5m (based on actual claims recieved)
+ layering can be horizontal or vertical, different reinsurers have different risk expertise
+ regression analysis is using historical data to determine the relationship between dependent and independent variables
+ probability analysis is focused on events and the dependence/interdependence characteristics of each
+ risk adverse firms want to move pay to move towards the concave utility function curve
+ idemnity contract is for actual losses and valued contract is for specific amount
+ pooling lowers the standard deviation bc participants share risks, correlation affects the risk reduction quality. diversify is creating independent risk units
+ r(p) r(f)
+ exante pre, expost post
+ "ly, the risk transfer/hedging markets can increase the available pools
    of unsystematic risk and promote greater financial stability by diffusing exposures; there is
    sufficient evidence to suggest that such mechanisms are quite resilient in the face of dislocation"
+ Passive rentention is from the system itself, active rentention is a conscious choice to hold onto the risk. Firms can choose to actively hold onto risks when risks can be predictable. Predicatability is an important factor when viewing a company's CF. It allows for accurate forecasting of business activities. Funding of these risks can be done pre or post loss and can be sourced internally or externally.
+ insurance can go to alternative market, the reverse is not proven
+ There is a balance on how accurate a forecasted loss should be. This is because it becomes expensive as accuracy goes up, which reduces competitiveness in the market. The premium loading is the portion that is adjusted to ensure a appropriate profit margin. These premiums can be adjusted based on schedule or experience ratings. 
+ investment returns can cushion a high combined ratio
+ The two simple parts of the insurance market cycle are labeled hard and soft. Soft is when there is excess supply of risk capacity, it follows that hard is then the limited supply of risk capacity. The hard market may be lucrative and will attract new compeititors. This will shift the market back into balance. Balance is important because it ensures the availability of loss-financing.
+ Diversifiication is attractive, even in comparision to absolute return. ART markets can provide this. In hard times, investors might want to allocate capital to buckets that are shielded from other holdings. This provides risk capacity to insurers, which in turn reduces the uncertainty related to optimal cover at a certain price for the claimant. 
+ arranging risk exposure, assuming risk, managing risk
+ Intermediaries connect members together. This increased network can be helpful, however it does introduce credit risk. Agreements now have another party, the intermediary, that can default or not fulfill its obligations. Financial or ART mechanisms are available to mitigate this risk. The ART market is especially useful in directing risks to specific destinations, destinations that are primed to take on such risks.
